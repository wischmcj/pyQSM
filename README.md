# pyQSM
Hopefully, the code in this repository will be provied as a python library for processessing TLS lidar scans and producting Qantitative Structural Models. Currently, this repo holds code for work on two use cases: (1) the isolation of individual trees from surrounding man made objects and (2) the isolation of various parts of a single tree (trunk, branches, leaves).
